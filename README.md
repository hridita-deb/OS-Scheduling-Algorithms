# ðŸ“˜ Operating System Algorithms

This repository contains C++ implementations of classic Operating System *scheduling algorithms*. These are commonly used in process management and taught in Operating Systems courses.

Currently, it includes:

> More algorithms like FCFS, SJF (Non-preemptive), and Priority Scheduling will be added soon.
